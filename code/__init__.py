"""The VoltageDimentionalReduction package is an implementation of
the voltage-based cloud-point mapping software

The code is organized as follows. The main classes are the problem class which defines a partition graph and the landmarks. THe local ...


The module/class Hierarchy is (top level modules (directories), divided into submodules (.py files), divided into classes) each one line of description. At this time there seems no need for directory-level modules. So the list should include just two levels: .py files and Classes. Functions should all be methods, i.e. part of a directory.

Current list of .py files is below. Consolidate into files/classes
with well defined roles.
